Insurance Fraud Detection Classififcation ML model using OneAPI (Decision Tree)

OneAPI, touted by Intel as a single, unified programming model that aims to simplify development across different hardware architectures: CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, AI accelerators, and more. All of them have very different properties and excel at different types of operations.

The grand idea behind oneAPI is to enable the use of one platform for a range of different hardware, hence developers would not have to use different languages, tools, and libraries when they code for CPUs and GPUs. 

In this project, we made use of Daal4py, DAAL4PY is a Python library that harnesses the power of Intelâ€™s Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL) within the OneAPI ecosystem. DAAL4PY is a game-changer when it comes to data analytics and machine learning operations, as it taps into the computational prowess of Intel CPUs.

The project is focused on building an Insurance Fraud Detection model using Intel OneAPI which can classify Insurance Fraud into two categories 0(Fraud Reported ) and 1(Fraud not reported). The classififcation algorithm used is Intel OneAPI's  'decision_tree_classifier'.
